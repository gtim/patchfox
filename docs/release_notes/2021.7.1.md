# Release 2021.7.1

This release is a major overhaul of Patchfox. It is laying the necessary groundwork for Patchfox to support multiple backends — nodejs-based ssb-server, browser-ssb server, go-ssb server — and become a viable main client.

There is comprehensive information about the [ROADMAP on SSB](ssb:message/sha256/Y2iyBckEhcWvxX6a1-9ELeP6wFYD80QNdhvR50V1C7E=), and the tasks have been broken into [discreet issues](https://github.com/soapdog/patchfox/issues) on Github.

Because there is so much going on, the release notes will give at a glance information only.

## Fixes & Improvements

* Made packages more backend agnostic by removing direct calls to nodejs-ssb-only features. For cases where this was not possible, made sure they detect what is the current backend before attempting to use such features.
* Provided ways for package developers to flag which backends their package supports, and also detect the running backend at runtime.
